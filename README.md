# GitHub Gists

This is a React-based web application that allows users to search for GitHub gists by username. 

## Getting Started

To use this app, you'll first need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download Node.js from the official website ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)), and npm will be included with your Node.js installation.

After installing Node.js and npm, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-gists.git
```

Next, navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd react-github-gist-search npm install
```

Finally, start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Usage

To use the app, simply enter a GitHub username in the search bar and press the "Search" button. The app will retrieve all of the public gists associated with that username from the GitHub API and display them on the page.

Click on any gist to view its details, including its description, files, and creation date.
